# PizzaPi
PizzaPi is a web and Android application that provides its users a convenient way of discovering recipes based on some list of ingredients. This repository is meant to revive PizzaPi for demonstration purposes. The sample provided by this repository lacks behind the original developed PizzaPi in the sense that it does not make use of real recipe data. The original PizzaPi requested temporary Academic access to recipe and ingredient data provided by the <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">FoodAPI</a>. The data was supplemented with information scraped from public websites, as allowed by their robots.txt file.

Overall, the sample illustrates a working full stack Android and web application that makes use of a Flask development web server and a PostgreSQL database.
